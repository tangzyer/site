I am an undergraduate at Tsinghua University with research interest in statistical machine learning, online learning and sequential decision making. I am extremenly lucky to be supervised by [Prof. Jie Ding](jding.org) and [Prof. Weina Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weinaw/) during my undergraduate study.
